"""
We build definition vectors so that we can find relevant definitions, and then
later display the associated wordforms. Unfortunately we donâ€™t currently have
any stable ID fields that we can use to refer to the wordform that the
definition came from. If we used the auto-generated wordform id pk, that would
become invalid whenever the dictionary was updated.

To deal with that, this file has functions to turn definitions into string keys that:
 1. Are unique per definition, so we can save multiple definitions per wordform
    into a KeyedVector
 2. Also refer unambiguously to a single wordform.
